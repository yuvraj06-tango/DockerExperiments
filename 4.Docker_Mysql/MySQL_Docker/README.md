# Running MySQL Using Docker 🐳📊

In this project, we will deploy a **MySQL database** using **Docker**, a powerful platform for containerizing applications. Docker ensures that your database is portable, scalable, and independent of the underlying system. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a MySQL database inside a Docker container, initializing it with a sample dataset, and interacting with it using SQL queries.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional MySQL database running inside a Docker container, ready for development or production use. 🚀

## Project Overview 📖

This project demonstrates how to containerize a MySQL database using Docker. The database is initialized with a sample schema and data, allowing you to interact with it using SQL queries. The setup is ideal for development, testing, or even production environments where portability and scalability are critical.

## Documentation 📚

For more information, refer to the official documentation:

- [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
- [Docker Desktop Documentation](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Prerequisites 📋

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
2. **Docker Desktop**: A tool to manage Docker containers on your local machine.

## Installation and Setup 🛠️

### Step 1: Verify Docker Installation

Run the following command in your terminal to check if Docker is installed:
```bash
docker --version
```

You should see an output similar to:

```bash
Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
```

## Project Structure 🗂️

The project consists of the following files:

1. database_students.sql: A SQL script to create a database and insert sample data.
2. Dockerfile: A script containing instructions for Docker to build an image.

## Create the SQL Script 📄

The database_students.sql file contains the SQL commands to create a database and insert sample data. Below is the content of the file:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE student;
USE student;

CREATE TABLE students (
    StudentID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Surname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID)
);

INSERT INTO students (FirstName, Surname)
VALUES ("John", "Andersen"), ("Emma", "Smith");
```

Explanation of the SQL Script:

1. CREATE DATABASE student;: Creates a new database named student.
2. USE student;: Switches to the student database.
3. CREATE TABLE students (...);: Creates a table named students with columns StudentID, FirstName, and Surname.
4. INSERT INTO students (...);: Inserts sample data into the students table.

## Dockerfile 📄

The Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for Docker to build an image. Below is the Dockerfile for this project:

```bash
# Use the official MySQL image as the base image
FROM mysql:latest

# Set the root password for MySQL
ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root

# Copy the SQL script to initialize the database
COPY ./database_students.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
```

Explanation of the Dockerfile:

1. FROM mysql:latest: Specifies the base image (official MySQL image).
2. ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root: Sets the root password for MySQL.
3. COPY ./database_students.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/: Copies the SQL script to the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d directory, which automatically executes the script when the container starts.

## Deployment 🚀

Step 1: Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t mysql_db .
```
* The -t flag tags the image with the name mysql_db.
* The . specifies the build context (current directory).
Step 2: Verify the Docker Image

Run the following command to list all Docker images:

```bash
docker images
```
You should see an output similar to:

```bash
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
mysql_db     latest    abc123def456   10 seconds ago   500MB
```

Step 3: Run the Docker Container

Start the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name mysql_container mysql_db
```

* The -d flag runs the container in detached mode.
* The --name flag assigns a name (mysql_container) to the container.
Step 4: Access the MySQL Container

To interact with the MySQL database, access the container's shell:

```bash
docker exec -it mysql_container /bin/bash
```

Step 5: Connect to MySQL

Connect to the MySQL server using the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
* Enter the root password (root) when prompted.
Step 6: Query the Database

Switch to the student database and query the students table:

```bash
USE student;
SELECT * FROM students;
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| StudentID | FirstName | Surname  |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
|         1 | John      | Andersen |
|         2 | Emma      | Smith    |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
```

## Conclusion 🎉

Congratulations! 🎉 You’ve successfully deployed a MySQL database using Docker. This setup ensures that your database is portable, scalable, and independent of the underlying system. Docker and MySQL together provide a powerful combination for building and deploying database-driven applications.

Keep exploring and building more complex applications with Docker and MySQL! 🚀📊

Happy coding! 💻✨
